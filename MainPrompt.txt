Teacher Timetables:

	Generate individual timetables for every teacher handling courses in Semesters 4, 6, and 8.

	Ensure no teacher is assigned to multiple periods at the same time.

	Display each teacher’s timetable in the same table format as the student timetable.

	Teachers’ timetables should only include the subjects they teach, indicating the semester in parentheses  (e.g., CS401 (S4)).

	A teacher can handle multiple subjects but should not have overlapping periods.

	If a subject has multiple teachers, ensure they do not get assigned to the same period.

	Practical sessions should be scheduled for full 3-hour blocks in teacher timetables.

Additional Rules:

	Each teacher’s lecture and practical hours should be evenly spread throughout the week to avoid overload on a single day

	No subject should exceed its required hours.

	Lab Hours should either happen in the first 3 hours or after 4th period.

	Theory and lecture hours should be evenly distributed across the week.

	Ensure all periods are filled without overlapping subjects.

	Always display the subject code with the subject notation in the timetable.
